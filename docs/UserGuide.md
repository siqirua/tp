# User Guide: ModuLight

ModuLight is a **desktop app** built for **professors from National University of Singapore to manage students and 
assessments** for a single module.

Here’s an overview of how Modulight can help you to streamline your module management process:
* Store and edit information about your students and various assessments.
* Calculate statistics on cohort performance for assessments and visualize them graphically.
* Track qualitative information about your students and assessments using tags and comments.

Furthermore, we believe that module management should be **efficient**. Therefore, Modulight is **optimized for use 
via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can 
type fast, ModuLight can get your student grading tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `ModuLight.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ModuLight.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar ModuLight.jar` 
   command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

**Notes on Graded Component and Student Score parameters for score calculation**<br>

* The maximum marks of a graded component and marks of a student score are both absolute values and are used together to determine the relative performance of a student for a component. For instance, if the maximum marks for a component Midterms is 50, and the marks for the student is 35, then the student scored 35/50 =70% on this graded component.

* The weightage of a graded component is used to determine its contribution to a student’s overall score, and is calculated relative to the sum of all other component weightages. For instance, if there are only 2 components in the system currently, and component A has weightage 30, and component B weightage 20, then component A currently represents 20/(20+30) = 60% of the student’s overall score. This is modified as components are added and removed.

</box>

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaning how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

### Add a student: `addStu`
Adds a student to the database. Throws error if student with same student number already exists. If it succeeds, an acknowledgement message is shown and data is saved. If it fails, an error message is shown instead.

Valid student numbers start and end with an upper-case alphabet, and have 7 numeric symbols in between.

Format: `addStu s/STUDENT_NO n/NAME e/EMAIL [g/TUTORIAL_GRP] [t/tags…]`
Examples: 
* `addStu s/A1234567Y n/Andy Ong g/T03 e/andy_ong@u.nus.edu` Adds a student with student number A1234567Y, name Andy Ong, with email andy_ong@u.nus.edu belonging to tutorial group T03 to the database.

### Edit a student : `editStu`
Edits an existing student’s details in the database, based on the 1-based index of the student shown in the currently visible Student list. If successful, an acknowledgement message will be shown in the result display and data is saved. Otherwise, a failure message is shown instead specifying the cause of failure.

1 or more fields to be edited must be provided in the command. The index provided must be more than 0 and not exceed the number of students displayed in the Student list. **If the student number is being edited, the edited student number cannot match the student number of any other student already in the database.**


Format: `editStu INDEX [s/STUDENT_NO] [g/TUTORIAL_GRP] [n/NAME] [e/EMAIL] [t/tags…]​`

Examples:
* `editStu 2 s/A1234567Y g/T03` edits the second student in the Student list to have student number A1234567Y, and have tutorial group T03.

### Delete a student : `deleteStu`
Deletes an existing student in the database, based on the 1-based index of the student shown in the currently visible Student list. If successful, an acknowledgement message will be shown in the output box and data is saved. Otherwise, a failure message is shown instead specifying the cause of failure.
The index provided must be at least 1 and not exceed the number of students displayed in the Student list.

Format: `deleteStu INDEX`

Examples:
* `deleteStu 1` deletes the first student in the currently visible Student list.

### Add a graded component: `addComp`
Adds a graded component to the database. The graded component name (cae-sensitve) cannot match any other existing graded component names in the dtabase. If successful, an acknowledgement message will be shown in the output box and data is saved. Otherwise, a failure message is shown instead specifying the cause of failure.

Upon successful creation of a graded component, a corresponding student score will be created for each student in the database. For instance, if a graded component with name “Midterms” is created and there are two students with student numbers “A1234567X” and “A1234567Y” in the database, then two student scores are created with titles  “A1234567X - Midterm” and “A1234567Y - Midterm”.

Weightage represents how much this component contributes when tabulating students’ total marks, and is calculated relative to the sum of all other component weightages. For instance, if there are only 2 components in the system currently, and component A has weightage 30, and component B weightage 20, then component A currently represents 60% of the grade. This is modified as components are added and removed.

Format: `addComp c/COMP_NAME w/WEIGHTAGE mm/MAX_MARKS`

Examples: `addComp c/Midterm w/30 mm/70`  adds a graded component called “Midterm” with a weightage of 30 and a maximum mark of 70.

### Edit a graded component: `editComp`
Edits an existing graded component’s details in the database, based on the 1-based index of the graded component shown in the Graded Components list. If successful, an acknowledgement message will be shown in the output box and data is saved. Otherwise, a failure message is shown instead specifying the cause of failure.
1 or more fields to be edited must be provided in the command. The index provided must be more than 0 and not exceed the number of graded components displayed in the Graded Components list. If the component name is being edited, the component name cannot match the component name of any other graded component already in the database.

Format: `editComp INDEX [c/COMP_NAME] [w/WEIGHTAGE] [mm/MAX_MARKS]`

Examples: `editComp 4 c/Midterm Exam mm/55` edits the fourth graded component in the Graded Components list to have a name of “Midterm Exam”, and a maximum mark of 55.

### Delete a graded component: `deleteComp`

Deletes an existing graded component in the database, based on the 1-based index of the graded component shown in the Graded Components list. 
If successful, an acknowledgement message will be shown in the output box and data is saved. Otherwise, a failure message is shown instead specifying the cause of failure.

The index provided must be more than 0 and not exceed the number of graded components displayed in the Graded Components list.

Format: `deleteComp INDEX`

Examples: `deleteComp 2` deletes the second graded component in the displayed Graded Components List

### Edit student score: `editScore`

Edits a student’s mark for a certain graded component, based on the 1-based index of the student score shown in the Student Scores list. If the mark exceeds the maximum mark, it will show up on the panel as such, but for internal calculations it will be treated as the maximum mark. This is to allow users to indicate “bonus” marks.

Note: a StudentScore will be automatically added when a graded component is created or when a new student is added. Similarly, student scores will be automatically deleted when its associated graded component or student is deleted.

Format: `editScore INDEX [m/SCORE] [x/comment]`

Examples: `editScore 7 m/57` assigns a mark of 57 for the seventh student score in the Student Scores list.


### Searching students: `findStu`

Shows all students who match the given search keyword of the specific parameter. All the relevant student scores and all graded components will be displayed as well.


Format: `findStu [s/STUDENT_NO] [n/NAME] [e/EMAIL] [g/TUTORIAL_GRP] [t/TAG]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `a0123456` will match `A0123456`
* You can search based on any of the following attributes: name, student number, email, tutorial group or tag.
* It is allowed to have 0 searching criteria. In this case, this command will simply list all students.
* For searching based on tutorial group and tag, it will find the students with exactly the same description
(case-insensitive). However, for searching based on student ID, name and email, it will find the students as long as the
description contains the searching criteria.
* For searching with multiple student parameters of the same type, it will find the students who satisfy any of the
criteria.
* For searching with student parameters of different types, it will find the students who satisfy all the criteria.
* For searching with multiple student parameters of different types, it will find the students who satisfy at least one
criterion for each type.
* If a input of the incorrect format is given, there might be no students found. For example, if you search findStu 
s/A00000Y, no students will be found since this is not a substring of any valid student number.

Examples:
* `findStu n/Alice n/Bob g/T01` returns the data of the students whose name contains 'Alice' or 'Bob' (case-insensitive)
while in tutorial group T01.

### Find students : `findComp`
Shows all students who match the given search keyword of the specific parameter. All the relevant student scores and 
all graded components will be displayed as well.

Format: `findComp c/COMP_NAME`

* Graded components whose name contains the keyword will be found.

Example: `findComp c/midterm` lists all graded component contains the string midterm  (and their associated scores). 
All graded students will be shown since they are relevant.

### Find students : `findScore`
Shows all student scores that matches the given search keyword of the specific parameter. No student or graded components will be displayed
Format: `findScore  [s/STUDENT_NO] [n/NAME] [e/EMAIL] [g/TUTORIAL_GRP] [c/COMP_NAME][x/comments][t/tags]...`
Example: `findScore g/T02 c/midterm` lists all midterm scores in tutorial group T02. The graded component and student list will be emptied.

### List all students : `listStu`
Shows a list of all students and associated student scores in separate panels respectively. The lists may be additionally filtered by optional arguments tutorial group. (can have more than 1)

Format: `listStu [g/TUTORIAL_GRP …]`

Examples:`listStu g/02 03` lists all students belonging to tutorial groups 02 and 03.


### List all : `listAll`
Shows all students, student scores and graded components in their lists respectively. This removes all the filter applied from the find command.

Format: `listAll`

Example: `listAll`

### Sorting students: `sortStu`

Sorts students' data by the given criteria.

Format: `sortStu [o/SORTING_ORDER] [r/REVERSE]`

* The sorting order keyword must be one of the acceptable description given below: <br>
"n", "name", "s", "studentId", "studentID", "e", "email", "g", "tutorial", "tut", "tutGroup""ts", "totalScore", 
"score", "totalscore".
* The reverse keyword must be one of the acceptable description given below: <br>
"decreasing", "0", "false", "f" (These 4 keywords have the same effect), "increasing", "1", "true", "t" (These 4 
keywords have the same effect).
* It is allowed to omit sorting order and reverse. In this case, the default sorting order is by total score while 
the default reverse is false (i.e. increasing).
* This command will only sort the currently displayed students. If you want to sort all students, please use `listStu`
command in advance.

Examples:
* `sortStu o/name r/true` returns the sorted students whose names are in descending alphabetical order.

### Sorting students scores: `sortStuScore`

Sorts students score by the given criteria.

Format: `sortStuScore [o/SORTING_ORDER] [r/REVERSE]`

* The sorting order keyword must be one of the acceptable description given below: <br>
  "n", "name", "s", "studentId", "studentID", "e", "email", "g", "tutorial", "tut", "tutGroup""ts", "totalScore",
  "score", "totalscore".
* The reverse keyword must be one of the acceptable description given below: <br>
  "decreasing", "0", "false", "f" (These 4 keywords have the same effect), "increasing", "1", "true", "t" (These 4
  keywords have the same effect).
* It is allowed to omit sorting order and reverse. In this case, the default sorting order is by total score while
  the default reverse is false (i.e. increasing).
* This command will only sort the currently displayed students. If you want to sort all students, please use `listAll`
  command in advance.

Examples:
* `sortStuScore o/score r/true` returns the sorted students whose names are in descending alphabetical order.

### Calculating overall statistics: `stats`

Calculates the overall statistics of all students.

Format: `stats [st/STATS] [g/TUTORIAL_GRP]`

* It is allowed to omit `[st/STATS]`. In this case, it will return a summary of all statistics that are currently
supported.
* For stats keywords, it must be currently supported. Here is an exhaustive list of currently supported statistical
measures: mean, standardDeviation, upperQuartile, lowerQuartile, max, min, skewness.
* It is allowed to have multiple stats keywords, but only allowed to have 0 or 1 tutorial group keywords.

Examples:
* `stats st/upperQuartile st/lowerQuartile` returns the upper and lower quartile of the overall student grades.

### Calculating statistics of a graded component : `compStats` 

Calculates the statistics of all students of a specific graded component.

Format: `compStats [c/COMP_NAME] [st/STATS] [g/TUTORIAL_GRP]`

### Saving the data

ModuLight data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Loading the previous data

There is no need to manually load data stored on the hard disc. It will be available automatically everytime the program starts.

### Editing the data file

ModuLight data are saved automatically as a set of 3 JSON files `[JAR file location]/data/studentBook.json`,
`[JAR file location]/data/gradedComponentBook.json`, `[JAR file location]/data/studentScoreBook.json`, 
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ModuLight will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.

## FAQ
**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Modulight home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
