# User Guide: ModuLight

## Welcome to ModuLight

_**Min-max your module management!**_

ModuLight is a **desktop app** built for **professors from National University of Singapore from the School of Computing to manage students and 
assessments** for a single module. This app is ideally designed for professors with intermediate or higher technical knowledge,
who are comfortable using the Command Line Interface (CLI) and terminal. We also assume that the professors are already familiar with module structures,
such as the graded components and their weightages and the number of students and tutorial groups.

Here’s an overview of how ModuLight can help you to streamline your module management process:
* Store and edit information about your students and various assessments.
* Calculate statistics on cohort performance for assessments and autograde based on customised parameters.
* Track qualitative information about your students and assessments using tags and comments.

Furthermore, we believe that module management should be **efficient**. Therefore, ModuLight is **optimized for use 
via a [Command Line Interface](#glossary)** while still having the benefits of a [Graphical User Interface (GUI)](#glossary). For those proficient in typing, ModuLight can get your student grading tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Parameter Information

ModuLight keeps track of a lists of students, a list of student scores and a list of graded components. 
   * A student contains the basic personal information of a student, such as student id, email and tutorial group.
   * A graded component is an assignment or assessment, for example a research report or midterm. It has a maximum mark and a weightage.
   * A student score is a score that a student obtained for a particular graded component. 

The following section gives an overview of the parameters used for the commands related to student, student score and graded component, as well as the constraints of these parameters.

**Graded Component and Student Score parameters for score calculation**

* The maximum marks of a graded component and marks of a student score are both **absolute values** and are used together to
  determine the relative performance of a student for a component. <br> 
   * For instance, if the maximum marks for a component `Midterms` is 50, and the marks for the student is 35, then the student scored 35/50 =70% on this graded component.
* The weightage of a graded component is used to determine its contribution to a student’s overall score, and is calculated
  **relative to the sum of all other component weightages**. <br> 
   * For example, in a system with only 2 components, if component A has a weightage of 30 and component B has a weightage of 20, then component A represents 20/(20+30) = 60% of the student’s overall score. This changes as components are added or removed.
  <br> Note that the **total weightage of all graded components should not exceed 100**.

<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-success">

**:bulb: Useful tips**:
> * If a graded component has a maximum mark of 0, the relative score for any associated student scores will be 0.
> * If a student or graded component has no associated student scores, the overall score will be listed as 0.

## Features

<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-primary">

**:information_source: Important alert**:
If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.  

</div>

## Add Commands
You can use the following commands to add a new student or graded component. 

<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-success">

**:bulb: Useful tips**:
Student scores will be automatically added when a new student or component is added.

</div>

### Add a student: `addStu`
You can use this command to add a student to the database so that you can track all students taking the course. <br>
Throws error if student with same student number already exists. If successful, an acknowledgement message is shown and data is saved. Otherwise, an error message is shown instead.

Format: `addStu s/STUDENT_NO n/NAME e/EMAIL [g/TUTORIAL_GRP] [t/tags…]`

* Valid student numbers start and end with an upper-case alphabet, and have 7 numeric symbols in between.
* it is allowed to omit the tutorial group. In this case, the student's tutorial group will be T00 by default.

Examples: 
* `addStu s/A1234567Y n/Andy Ong g/T03 e/andy_ong@u.nus.edu` Adds a student with student number A1234567Y, name Andy Ong, with email andy_ong@<span></span>u.nus.edu belonging to tutorial group T03 to the database.

![addStu](images/addStu_ui.png
)

### Add a graded component: `addComp`
You can use this command to add a graded component to the database so that you can track all graded components in my course thus far. <br>
If successful, an acknowledgement message will be shown in the output box and data is saved. Otherwise, a failure message is shown instead specifying the cause of failure.

Upon successful creation of a graded component, a corresponding student score will be created for each student in the database. For instance, if a graded component with name “Midterms” is created and there are two students with student numbers `A1234567X` and `A1234567Y` in the database, then two student scores are created with titles `A1234567X - Midterm` and `A1234567Y - Midterm`.

* When adding the component, you must ensure that the total weightage of all components does not exceed 100.
* Weightage is a relative value calculated relative to the sum of all other weightage values. For more details, view [the notes on score calculations](#command-related-parameters).
* Please refrain from entering numbers with more than 2 decimal places of precision.

Format: `addComp c/COMP_NAME w/WEIGHTAGE mm/MAX_MARKS`

Examples: `addComp c/Midterm w/30 mm/70`  adds a graded component called “Midterm” with a weightage of 30 and a maximum mark of 70.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Edit Commands

You can use the following commands to edit a student, student score or graded component.

<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-success" >

**:bulb: Useful tips**:
A student score is related to a student and a graded component. Thus, when one entity is edited, its information in all related entities will be edited as well.
For instance, when a student's student ID is edited, the change will be reflected in all scores that belong to this student.

</div>

### Edit a student : `editStu`
You can use this command to edit an existing student’s details in the database so that you can update outdated student information or correct mistakes, based on the 1-based index of the student shown in the currently visible Student list. <br>
If successful, an acknowledgement message will be shown in the result display and data is saved. Otherwise, a failure message is shown instead specifying the cause of failure.

Format: `editStu INDEX [s/STUDENT_NO] [g/TUTORIAL_GRP] [n/NAME] [e/EMAIL] [t/tags…]​`

* 1 or more fields to be edited must be provided in the command.
* The index provided must be more than 0 and not exceed the number of students displayed in the Student list.
* If the student number is being edited, the edited student number must be different from any other student already in the database.**

Examples:
* `editStu 2 s/A9999999W g/T03` edits the second student in the Student list to have student number A9999999W, and have tutorial group T03.

![editStu](images/editStu_ui.png)

### Edit a graded component: `editComp`
You can use this command to edit an existing graded component’s details in the database so that you can make changes to a component (e.g. modify weightage) or correct mistakes, based on the 1-based index of the graded component shown in the Graded Components list. <br>
If successful, an acknowledgement message will be shown in the output box and data is saved. Otherwise, a failure message is shown instead specifying the cause of failure.

* 1 or more fields to be edited must be provided in the command. 
* The index provided must be more than 0 and not exceed the number of graded components displayed in the Graded Components list. 
* If the component name is being edited, the component name cannot match the component name of any other graded component already in the database.
* When editing the component, you must ensure that the total weightage of all components does not exceed 100.
* If editing the maximum marks, ensure none of the current student scores exceed the new maximum marks.
* Weightage is a relative value calculated relative to the sum of all other weightage values. For more details, view [the notes on score calculations](#command-related-parameters).
* Please refrain from entering numbers with more than 2 decimal places of precision.

Format: `editComp INDEX [c/COMP_NAME] [w/WEIGHTAGE] [mm/MAX_MARKS]`


* if no parameters except index are passed in, it will throw an error.


Examples: `editComp 4 c/Midterm Exam mm/55` edits the fourth graded component in the Graded Components list to have a name of “Midterm Exam”, and a maximum mark of 55.


### Edit student score: `editScore`

You can use this command to edit a student’s mark for a certain graded component so that you can regrade student scripts or correct mistakes, based on the 1-based index of the student score shown in the Student Scores list.

Note: a StudentScore will be automatically added when a graded component is created or when a new student is added. Similarly, student scores will be automatically deleted when its associated graded component or student is deleted.

* 1 or more fields to be edited must be provided in the command.
* The index provided must be more than 0 and not exceed the number of student scores displayed in the Student Scores list.
* The mark given cannot exceed the maximum marks for the associated graded component.
* Please refrain from entering numbers with more than 2 decimal places of precision.

Format: `editScore INDEX [m/SCORE] [x/comment] [t/tags]`

* if the mark is being edited, the new mark should be more than 0 and not exceed the associated component's maximum marks.
* if no parameters except index are passed in, it will throw an error.

Examples: `editScore 7 m/57` assigns a mark of 57 for the seventh student score in the Student Scores list.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Delete Commands
You can use the following commands to delete a student or graded component from the database.

<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-success">

**:bulb: Useful tips**:
Student scores will be automatically deleted when the corresponding student or component is deleted.
For instance, when a student is deleted, all scores that belong to this student will be deleted. They will be deleted from the graded components as well.

</div>

### Delete a student : `deleteStu`
You can use this command to delete an existing student in the database so that you can remove students dropping the course/wrongly assigned, based on the 1-based index of the student shown in the currently visible Student list. <br>
If successful, an acknowledgement message will be shown in the output box and data is saved. Otherwise, a failure message is shown instead specifying the cause of failure.

Format: `deleteStu INDEX`

* The index provided must be at least 1 and not exceed the number of students displayed in the Student list.

Examples:
* `deleteStu 7` deletes the seventh student in the currently visible Student list.

![deleteStu](images/deleteStu_ui.png)

### Delete a graded component: `deleteComp`

You can use this command to delete an existing graded component in the database so that you can remove a graded component when it is deemed unnecessary, based on the 1-based index of the graded component shown in the displayed Graded Components list. <br>
If successful, an acknowledgement message will be shown in the output box and data is saved. Otherwise, a failure message is shown instead specifying the cause of failure.

Format: `deleteComp INDEX`

* The index provided must be more than 0 and not exceed the number of graded components displayed in the Graded Components list.

Examples: `deleteComp 2` deletes the second graded component in the displayed Graded Components List

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* For searching with multiple parameters of different types, it will find the objects which satisfy at least one
   criterion for each type.

<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-success">

**:bulb: Useful tips**:
* If a student number of the incorrect format is given, there might be no entity found. For example, if you search findStu
   s/A00000Y, no students will be found since this is not a substring of any valid student number.<br>
* If you would like to see the complete lists again, please use the [`listAll` command](#list-all-listall).

</div>

### Find students: `findStu`

You can use this command to shows all students who match the given search keyword of the specific parameter.<br>
All the relevant student scores will be displayed as well so that you can quickly find information about a student and their scores without having to search through the list. All graded components will be displayed as they are relevant.

Format: `findStu [s/STUDENT_NO...] [n/NAME...] [e/EMAIL...] [g/TUTORIAL_GRP...] [t/TAG...]`

Examples:
* `findStu s/A000000Y` returns the data of the student whose student ID is A0000000Y.

![findStu](images/findStu_ui.png)

### Find graded components : `findComp`
You can use this command to show all graded components who match the given search keyword of the specific parameter. All the relevant student scores and 
all students will be displayed as well so that you can quickly find information about a graded component and the scores without having to search through the list.

Format: `findComp [c/COMP_NAME]`

Example: `findComp c/midterm` lists all graded components containing the string midterm  (and their associated scores). 
All students will be shown since they are relevant.

### Find student scores : `findScore`
You can use this command to show all student scores that matches the given search keyword of the specific parameter so that you can quickly find information about a student score without having to search through the list. No student or graded components will be displayed.
Format: `findScore  [s/STUDENT_NO...] [n/NAME...] [e/EMAIL...] [g/TUTORIAL_GRP...] [c/COMP_NAME...][x/comments...][t/tags...]`

Example: `findScore g/T02 c/midterm` lists all midterm scores in tutorial group T02. The graded component and student list will be emptied.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Sort Commands
You can use the following commands to sort the students or student scores by a given criteria.

### Sorting students: `sortStu`

You can use this command to sort student data by the given criteria so that you can find the top students easily.

Format: `sortStu [o/SORTING_ORDER] [r/REVERSE_ORDER]`

* The sorting order keyword must be one of the acceptable description provided below: <br>

| Accepted keywords                  | Field to be sorted | Description                                         |
|------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `n`, `name`                        | `n/`               | Name of the student by alphabetical order           |
| `s`, `studentId`, `studentID`      | `s/`               | Student ID of the student by alphabetical order     |
| `e`, `email`                       | `e/`               | Email of the student by alphabetical order          |
| `g`, `tutorial`, `tut`, `tutGroup` | `g/`               | Tutorial group of the student by alphabetical order |
| `ts`, `totalScore`, `score`        | NIL                | Total score of the student by numerical value       |

* The reverse order keyword must be one of the acceptable description given below: <br>
"decreasing", "0", "false", "f" (These 4 keywords have the same effect), "increasing", "1", "true", "t" (These 4 
keywords have the same effect).
* It is allowed to omit sorting order and reverse order. In this case, the default sorting order is by total score while 
the default reverse order is false (i.e. increasing).
* This command sorts only the currently displayed students. To sort all students, please use `listStu`
command in advance. If there is no currently displayed student, the command can still execute successfully, but the list of
students will remain unchanged.

Examples:
* `sortStu o/name r/true` displays the students sorted in descending alphabetical order by their names.

![sortStu](images/sortStu_ui.png)

### Sorting students scores: `sortScore`

You can use this command to sort students score by the given criteria and display its associated students in order so that you can find the top students with their associated scores easily .

Format: `sortScore c/COMP_NAME [r/REVERSE_ORDER]`

* The reverse order keyword must be one of the acceptable description given below: <br>
  "decreasing", "0", "false", "f" (These 4 keywords have the same effect), "increasing", "1", "true", "t" (These 4
  keywords have the same effect).
* It is allowed to omit reverse order. In this case, the default reverse order is false (i.e. increasing).
* This command will only sort the currently displayed students. If you want to sort all students, please use `listAll`
  command in advance. If there is no currently displayed student, the command can still execute successfully, but the lists of
  students and student scores will remain unchanged.

Examples:
* `sortScore c/Midterm r/true` returns the sorted students whose midterm scores are in descending order.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Statistics and Auto Grading Commands
### Auto grading all the students: `autoGrade`

You can use this command to automatically assigns grades to all students based on their total score and
the automatic grading method so that you can significantly reduce the time needed to grade the students and avoid manually grading each student.

Format: `autoGrade ag/METHOD pg/PASSING_VALUE`
 
There are 2 possible `METHOD`:
  * Percentile Method: `p`, `percentile`, `Percentile`
    * Calculate students' grade based on the statistical percentile.
  * Absolute Score Method: `a`, `absolute`, `Absolute`
    * Calculate students' grade based on the given passing grade values.
    * the absolute value is compared directly with the students' total score (in percentage of the maximum score possible).

The `PASSING_VALUE` are numbers that determine the boundary for each grade
  * The structure of `PASSING_VALUE`: `[A+] [A] [A-] [B+] [B] [B-] [C+] [C] [D+] [D] [F]`
  * Each bracket represents the boundary value for the grade.
    * For `percentile` method, it is the statistical percentile value.
    * For `absolute` method, it is the total score.
  * It is **not** compulsory to fill all the `PASSING_VALUE`, but such approach would make students below the lowest given passing value to be graded `F`. 
  * Example: `pg/90 80 65 40 30`. This would correspond to:
    * Value `90` given to `A+`
    * Value `80` given to `A`
    * Value `65` given to `A-`
    * Value `40` given to `B+`
    * Value `30` given to `B`
    * Any Value below `30` will be given `F`

<div markdown="1" class="alert alert-success">

**:bulb: Useful tips**:
The `autoGrade` command works on the filtered student list. This would allow for example, to grade students only compared to their own tutorial group. To automatically grade every student in the module, please use `findStu` command to display every student.

</div>

Example:
* `autoGrade ag/absolute pg/95 80 70 55 40 20`. This would automatically grade student by using absolute grade threshold. Student with total score `95%` above will be given `A+`, total score below `95%` and `90` above will be given `A`, and so on, while below `20%` will be given `F`.

![autoGrade](images/autoGrade_ui.png)

### Calculating overall statistics: `stats`

You can use this command to calculate overall statistics of all students so that you can have a quick insight of how your students are performing.

Format: `stats [st/STATS] [g/TUTORIAL_GRP]`

* It is allowed to omit `[st/STATS]`. In this case, it will return a summary of all currently supported statistics.
* For stats keywords, it must be currently supported. Here is an exhaustive list of currently supported statistical
measures: `mean`, `standardDeviation`, `upperQuartile`, `lowerQuartile`, `max`, `min`, `skewness`.
* For the calculation of upper and lower quartile, we use Method 4 introduced in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile).
* If there is only valid score matching the criteria, skewness will be displayed as `NaN` because skewness for one data
is meaningless.
* Multiple stats keywords are allowed, but only 0 or 1 tutorial group keyword is allowed.

Examples:
* `stats st/upperQuartile st/lowerQuartile` returns the upper and lower quartile of the overall student grades.

![stats](images/stats_ui.png)

### Calculating statistics of a graded component : `compStats` 

You can calculate statistics of all student scores of a specific graded component so that you can have a quick insight of how my students are performing in a specific assignment.

Format: `compStats c/COMP_NAME [st/STATS] [g/TUTORIAL_GRP]`

* It is allowed to omit `[st/STATS]`. In this case, it will return a summary of all statistics that are currently
  supported.
* For stats keywords, it must be currently supported. Here is an exhaustive list of currently supported statistical
  measures: `mean`, `standardDeviation`, `upperQuartile`, `lowerQuartile`, `max`, `min`, `skewness`.
* For the calculation of upper and lower quartile, we use Method 4 introduced 
in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile).
* If there is only valid score matching the criteria, skewness will be displayed as `NaN` because skewness for one data
is meaningless.
* Multiple stats keywords are allowed, but only 0 or 1 tutorial group keyword is allowed.


Examples:
* `compStats st/upperQuartile st/lowerQuartile c/Midterm` returns the upper and lower quartile of the 
student grades in Midterm.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Other Commands
### Viewing help : `help`

You can use this command to show a message explaining how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

### List all : `listAll`
You can use this command to show all students, student scores and graded components in their lists respectively. This removes all the filter applied from the find command.

Format: `listAll`

Example: `listAll`

### Clearing all entries : `clearAll`

You can use this command to clear all data from ModuLight.

Format: `clearAll`

* The clearing process is irreversible.


### Exiting the program : `exit`

You can use this command to exit the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

ModuLight data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need for you to save manually.

### Loading the previous data

There is no need to manually load data stored on the hard disc. It will be available automatically everytime the program starts.

## FAQ
1. **Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
   **A**: You can install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ModuLight home folder.

2. **Q**: How does the calculation of scores work?<br>
   **A**: You may refer to the [notes on score calculations](#command-related-parameters).

3. **Q**: Does the display update information (e.g. name, mean) in real time?<br>
   **A**: Yes.

4. **Q**: Why should I avoid entering numbers with more than 2 decimal places of precision?<br>
   **A**: Numerical errors have been known to occur due to the limits of floating-point precision on computers.

5. **Q**: What should I do if the application GUI opens off-screen when switching from multiple screens to a single screen?<br>
   **A**: If you move the application to a secondary screen and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI may open off-screen. To resolve this issue, delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running it again. This ensures that the GUI is properly displayed on the primary screen.

6. **Q**: How do I verify the java version installed in my computer? <br>
   **A**: You can open a terminal and enter "java -version". The java version installed will be displayed in the terminal window.

7. **Q**: How do I open a terminal?<br>
   **A**: It depends on the operating system.
   * **Mac**: Open launchpad and search for terminal. Click the app icon to open terminal.
   * **Windows**: In Windows Search, search for terminal and select Windows Terminal from the search results.
